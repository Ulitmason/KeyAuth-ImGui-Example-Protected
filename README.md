# KeyAuth ImGui Example - Enhanced Protection

This approach offers heightened security compared to client-side authentication, provided it's executed properly and supplemented by extra precautions.

---

### Correct Implementation Guidelines:

1. **Packet Encryption**: Encrypt the packets to ensure their confidentiality during transmission.

2. **Single-Use Packets**: Render packets invalid after a single use. This prevents reuse attempts and enhances security.

3. **Server-Controlled Operations**: Manage critical application aspects from the server side. Similar to how I've demonstrated parameter setting for MessageBoxA in the example, ensure that key application components are controlled from the server. This thwarts crackers' attempts to directly access functions and bypass authentication.

By meticulously adhering to these practices, you can fortify the security of your KeyAuth ImGui example and ensure a robust barrier against unauthorized access.



### Compilation Guide

**Prerequisites**:
- A Windows machine equipped with Visual Studio.

---

**Building the Server**:

1. Download the Repo to your computer as zip

3. Proceed to build the project.

4. Execute the `server` application.

---

**Building the Client**:


1. Launch the solution file in Visual Studio.

2. Select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu or press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to compile the project.
3. When the build is complete, select **Start Without Debugging** from the **Debug** menu or press `Ctrl+F5` to run the KeyauthBypass.

- Following these steps meticulously should result in successful compilation of both the server and client components of the project.

**KeyAuth CPP Example**

- Download the repository.
- Extract the contents of `libs.zip` to create a `libs` folder in your project. You can then delete the `libs.zip` file.
- Integrate application information into the `main.cpp` file. Refer to this video tutorial if needed: [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uJ0Umy_C6Fg)

With these adjustments made, your code is now ready for compilation.
